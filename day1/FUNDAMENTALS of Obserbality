OBSERBALITY:
WHAT AND WHY?
INTERNAL STATE SYSTEM:
                  DISK UTLIZATION,
                  CPU UTILIZATION,
                  MEMORY UTILIZATION 
                  AND NUMBER OF HTTP REQUESTS(SUCCESS/FAILURE)
                  MEMORY LEAK
METRICS-->HISTROICAL DATA OF AN EVENTS                  
LOGS--> LOGS F THAT ISSUES
TRACES-->ROOT CAUSE/FIXING FOR ISSUES

MONITRING ONLY DOES METRICS-->ALERTS-->DASHBOARDS
WHY SO MUC EFFORTS TO CONFIGURE OBSERBALITY-->SLA(RESUME BUILDER)-->OBJECTIVES(PROMOSING 99.99%)
IMPLEMENTING OBSERBALITY IS COLLECTIVE EFFORT
                    DEVELOPERS-->INSTRUMENT{METRICS, LOGS, TRACES}
                    DEVOPS TEAM-->PROMETHEUS,EFK,AND JAEGER
